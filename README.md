# X / Twitter AI Post Blocker

A Chrome extension that hides posts (tweets) from your X (Twitter) feed that talk about AI.

If it blocked all content that was posted by AI, there would be nothing displayed on the feed.

## Installation

2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select this project folder

## Usage

- The extension runs automatically on X (twitter.com and x.com). Tweets containing AI-related keywords (ChatGPT, machine learning, LLM, etc.) are hidden from your feed.
- Click the extension icon in the toolbar to toggle the blocker on or off.
- Refresh X/Twitter after installing to see it in action.

## What gets hidden

Tweets are hidden when they contain terms like:
- AI, ChatGPT, GPT, Claude, Gemini
- Machine learning, deep learning, neural networks
- LLM, large language model, generative AI
- Prompt engineering, RAG, embeddings
- And many more AI-related phrases
